# ContentPipe

Turns a news story and its source links into a production-ready video brief: researched dossier, narrative plan, scene-by-scene script, layered image prompts, motion direction and source citations — exported as Markdown.

Built on the Gemini API. Node + Express serving a Vite/React front end from one process.

---

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env      # then add your GEMINI_API_KEY
npm run dev               # http://localhost:3000
```

Port 3000 in use? `PORT=3100 npm run dev`.

---

## Environment

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | **Yes** | Every AI call. Get one at [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey). |
| `NOTEBOOKLM_API_KEY` | No | Falls back to `GEMINI_API_KEY`. |
| `APP_URL` | No | Self-referential links. |
| `PORT` | No | Defaults to 3000. |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_*` | Only for Google Docs export | Client-side Firebase Auth config. See [Google Workspace export](#google-workspace-export-optional). |

`.env` is gitignored. `.env.example` holds placeholders only — never commit real values.

> The server reads `.env` at startup via `dotenv/config`. **Restart after changing it**; there is no hot-reload for environment variables.

## The pipeline

Five stages, each its own endpoint. The UI walks them in order.

  /api/export/markdown ── writes the brief to exports/
```

### Research is real, within limits

`/api/research` fetches every URL you supply (or any URL found in the pasted text), strips the HTML to prose, and feeds that into the prompt. Facts come back with `factCitations` mapping each claim to the source that supports it, and `retrievedSources` records exactly what was read — including what failed and why.

If a page can't be fetched (paywall, JS-rendered, timeout) it is reported as `ok: false` rather than silently ignored, and the exported brief carries a warning banner. **A brief with no retrieved sources is unverified model output** and says so at the top.

> **Not used: Google Search grounding.** The `google_search` tool has zero quota on the Gemini free tier — grounded calls 429 immediately while plain calls succeed. If you enable billing, adding it is a small change to `/api/research`; note that grounding and `responseSchema` are mutually exclusive, so it needs a second structuring call.

### Script generation runs in three passes

Not one call, deliberately.

| Pass | Produces | Schema |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Production bible | `characterBible`, `styleGuide` | `productionBibleSchema` |
| 2. Narrative | scenes: narration, cinematography, infographics | `scriptSchema` |
| 3. Art direction | per scene: `visual`, `motion`, `citations` | `visualDirectionSchema` |

**Why split:** on a single combined schema, models return `finishReason: STOP` while silently omitting required fields. Observed with `gemini-3.6-flash`: `characterBible`, `styleGuide`, `visual` and `motion` all absent despite being listed in `required`. The same fields come back reliably when each pass gets a small, focused schema. If you merge these passes back together, expect fields to start disappearing.

Array bounds matter too — without `minItems` on `scenes`, the model returns a single scene and stops.

### Character consistency

The mechanism is `promptAnchor`: one dense clause per character, generated once in pass 1, then pasted **verbatim** into every scene's `visual.character`. Rewording it between scenes is what makes a character's face drift across generated images. Same idea for `styleAnchor`, which the server forces to be byte-identical across all scenes.

---

## Exports

`POST /api/export/markdown` writes a full brief to `exports/`, named `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`, never overwriting (`-2`, `-3` suffixes). `GET /api/export/list` enumerates them.

Each brief contains YAML front matter, a production summary, the source table with read/failed status, fact attribution, the style guide, the character bible with copy-paste anchors, a continuous narration teleprompter, a shot list, and per scene: narration, layered image prompts (character / background / composed / style / negative), motion parameters with a paste-ready `motionPrompt`, and infographic data.

`exports/` is gitignored — these are working artefacts.

In the UI the button lives in the export modal as **Save Markdown to exports/**. It needs no sign-in.

---

## Model configuration

All text generation uses the `TEXT_MODELS` chain in `server.ts`, tried best-first:

```ts
const TEXT_MODELS = ['gemini-3.7-flash', 'gemini-3.6-flash', 'gemini-3.1-flash-lite'];
```

**Do not put `gemini-2.5-flash` at the front of this list.** Google returns `404 — no longer available to new users` for it on accounts created recently, so leading with it burns a guaranteed-failed call on every request. The fallback chain exists because the 3.x Flash models return transient `503 high demand` on the free tier regularly; `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` is the most consistently available.

To see what your key can actually reach:

```bash
curl -s "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models" \
  -H "x-goog-api-key: $GEMINI_API_KEY" | jq -r '.models[].name'
```

Note that ListModels is not proof of access — `gemini-2.5-flash` appears in that listing and still 404s on `generateContent`.

> **zsh gotcha:** `"$m:generateContent"` in a URL is parsed as a history modifier and silently mangles the model name. Use `"${m}:generateContent"`.

---

## Known free-tier limits

| Capability | Free tier | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Text generation | Works | Occasional `503` on 3.x Flash; the chain handles it |
| TTS | Works | `gemini-3.1-flash-tts-preview` |
| **Image generation** | **Blocked** | `limit: 0` on `generate_content_free_tier_requests` for every image model — not a rate limit, no quota exists. Falls back to placeholder SVGs. Needs billing. |
| **Google Search grounding** | **Blocked** | 429 immediately. Needs billing. |

Image generation failing is expected on free tier; `isQuotaFallback: true` in the response means you got a placeholder, not artwork.

## Google Workspace export (optional)

Creating a file in Google Drive requires OAuth — there is no anonymous path, and `GEMINI_API_KEY` is unrelated (it identifies a project, not a person). If you don't want to sign in, use the Markdown export instead; Drive converts an uploaded `.docx`/`.md` anyway.

To make it work locally, add `localhost` to **Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains**. AI Studio-provisioned projects only authorize their Cloud Run domains, so `localhost` is missing by default and you get `auth/unauthorized-domain`.

Check the current list without opening the console:

```bash
curl -s "https://identitytoolkit.googleapis.com/v1/projects?key=$VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY" | jq .authorizedDomains
```

---

## Scripts

```bash
npm run dev      # tsx server.ts — Express + Vite middleware
npm run build    # vite build + esbuild bundle -> dist/
npm start        # node dist/server.cjs
npm run lint     # tsc --noEmit
```

---

## Layout

```
server.ts                     Express app, all endpoints, model chain
server/
  schemas.ts                  Gemini responseSchema definitions
  sourceFetcher.ts            URL fetching + HTML-to-text extraction
  markdownExporter.ts         Brief rendering + file writing
  fallbackGenerators.ts       Canned output when the API is unreachable
  notebooklmService.ts        Multi-voice podcast audio
src/
  App.tsx                     Stage orchestration
  components/                 One component per pipeline stage
  types.ts                    Shared types — mirrors server/schemas.ts
  utils/googleWorkspace.ts    Firebase Auth + Docs/Sheets export
exports/                      Generated briefs (gitignored)
```

`src/types.ts` and `server/schemas.ts` describe the same shapes in two languages. **Change both together** or the schema will quietly stop matching what the UI reads.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Everything reads like canned content about an XZ backdoor.** You're getting `generateFallbackGenerators` output. Check `isQuotaFallback` in the response, then check that `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set *and* the server was restarted after setting it.

**`EADDRINUSE: 0.0.0.0:3000`.** Something else owns the port — Grafana is a common culprit. Use `PORT=3100 npm run dev`.

**Scenes missing `visual` or `motion`.** A pass returned incomplete output. Check the server log for `[Art Director]` and `[Production Bible]` lines, which report coverage. Don't fix it by merging schemas.

**`auth/unauthorized-domain`.** See [Google Workspace export](#google-workspace-export-optional).
